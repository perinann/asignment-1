I'm in my final semester of the MA Sustainable International Development program at the Heller School.
I have a concentration in environment and am interested in the human-focused side of sustainability. Currently, I am thinking of focusing on environmental justice. My master's paper is a policy brief looking at landfills in Delhi, India.
I like working within structures and frameworks, and playing with data and figures, which is why I have recently developed an interest in data analysis. I've taken a few classes touching upon Excel, Tableau, SQL, R, and STATA, and am keen to learn some Python through this class.
I am hoping to find a role that will allow me to apply and analyse data while working with climate justice and sustainability on the ground. Currently, I am looking into M&E roles.
I love being outdoors, and have enjoyed exploring hiking and camping in New England over the past year.
