Assignment 1 answers & steps taken


Question 1. Create directory called answers
~/Applications/GitHub/assignment-1 (main)
$ mkdir answers

Question 2. Create file called answers.txt
~/Applications/GitHub/assignment-1 (main)
$ cd answers/
~/Applications/GitHub/assignment-1/answers (main)
$ nano answers.txt

Question 3. Edit the file
Copied the above commands using nano and used ctrl+O to save, ctrl+X to exit

Question 4. List absolute path to answers.txt
~/Applications/GitHub/assignment-1/answers/answers.txt

Question 5. Listing files in a directory including hidden files
The -a flag will list hidden files

Question 6. Listing files of another directory
use ls followed by the path to the directory.
e.g. to list files within the folder "college" on my device, I would use 
$ ls ~/OneDrive/Documents/College

Question 7. rm
rm could potentially be dangerous as it permanently removes/deletes files without a way to bring them back (i.e. it doesn't send them to a recycle bin)
A simple example would be if you have 2 directories with similar names, one which is to be deleted and the other which has important data, and use rm -r on the wrong directory. This cannot be retrieved and all data within the directory would be permanently lost.

Question 8. 
$ mkdir results 

Question 9. 
$ nano my_script.sh
